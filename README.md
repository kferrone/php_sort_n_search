# PHP Sort n Search

Just a little test project for learning sorting and searching algorithms and testing them out. 

## Requirements

 * PHP
 * PHP CLI (should just come with php)
 * PHP command available on terminal
 
try the command below to make sure you have PHP installed and on your `PATH`. 

```
php -v
```

Make sure to `cd` into the project before you do anything. 

## Run it

Run the more advanced Quick sort with shuffle.

 ```
 php -f cli.php sort
 ```
 
 Run the simpler and more common quick sort.

 Run both of them and test which is faster.
